	  Enable encryption of files and directories.  This
	  feature is similar to ecryptfs, but it is more memory
	  efficient since it avoids caching the encrypted and
	  decrypted pages in the page cache.  Currently Ext4,
	  F2FS and UBIFS make use of this feature.

# Filesystems supporting encryption must select this if FS_ENCRYPTION.  This
