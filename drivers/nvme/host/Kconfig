config BLK_DEV_NVME
	tristate "NVM Express block device"
	depends on PCI && BLOCK
	---help---
	  The NVM Express driver is for solid state drives directly
	  connected to the PCI or PCI Express bus.  If you know you
	  don't have one of these, it is safe to answer N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nvme.

config BLK_DEV_NVME_SCSI
	bool "SCSI emulation for NVMe device nodes"
	depends on BLK_DEV_NVME
	---help---
	  This adds support for the SG_IO ioctl on the NVMe character
	  and block devices nodes, as well a a translation for a small
	  number of selected SCSI commands to NVMe commands to the NVMe
	  driver.  If you don't know what this means you probably want
	  to say N here, and if you know what it means you probably
	  want to say N as well.
