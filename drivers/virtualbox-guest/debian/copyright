It was downloaded from <https://www.virtualbox.org/>.

This package is not part of the Debian operating system.
It is in the "contrib" area of the Debian archive because it requires a
non-free compiler (Open Watcom) to build the BIOS.
Upstream provides pre-built BIOS images which is used instead.

License:

    Preliminary notes:

    1) The majority of code in the VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is
    copyrighted by Oracle Corporation. This code is combined with third-party code
    that was originally released under licenses which the Free Software Foundation
    considers incompatible with the GPL, such as the Apache License 2.0, the OpenSSL
    license, the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and the Slirp license. (Please see the
    VirtualBox User Manual for a complete list of third-party code and their
    licenses.) As a special exception to the terms and conditions of the GPL listed
    below, Oracle gives you explicit permission to combine its GPL code contained in
    VirtualBox OSE with third-party code under the aforementioned licenses. You may
    copy and distribute such a combination provided that you adhere to the terms and
    conditions of all of the GPL and the licenses of the third-party code; in
    particular, you must include the source code of the entire combination insofar
    as the GPL requires distribution of source code.

    2) The GPL listed below does not bind software which uses VirtualBox services by
    merely linking to VirtualBox libraries so long as all VirtualBox interfaces used
    by that software are multi-licensed. A VirtualBox interface is deemed
    multi-licensed if it is declared in a VirtualBox header file that is licensed
    under both the GPL version 2 (below) *and* the Common Development and
    Distribution License Version 1.0 (CDDL), as it comes in the "COPYING.CDDL" file.
    In other words, calling such a multi-licensed interface is merely considered
    normal use of VirtualBox and does not turn the calling code into a derived work
    of VirtualBox. In particular, this applies to code that wants to extend
    VirtualBox by way of the Extension Pack mechanism declared in the ExtPack.h
    header file.

    3) Whoever creates or distributes a derived work based on VirtualBox OSE is not
    obligated to grant the above exceptions for such a version. The GPL allows for
    releasing a modified version without the above exception; in addition, Oracle
    hereby also allows you to release a modified version which carries forward these
    exceptions.


    Most files are licensed under the GPLv2:

      This file is part of VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE), as
      available from http://www.virtualbox.org. This file is free software;
      you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
      General Public License (GPL) as published by the Free Software
      Foundation, in version 2 as it comes in the "COPYING" file of the
      VirtualBox OSE distribution. VirtualBox OSE is distributed in the
      hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY of any kind.

    Some have this addition:

      The contents of this file may alternatively be used under the terms
      of the Common Development and Distribution License Version 1.0
      (CDDL) only, as it comes in the "COPYING.CDDL" file of the
      VirtualBox OSE distribution, in which case the provisions of the
      CDDL are applicable instead of those of the GPL.

      You may elect to license modified versions of this file under the
      terms and conditions of either the GPL or the CDDL or both.

    non-exclusive license:

        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
            trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use,
            reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and

            dispose of the Original Software (or portions thereof).

        (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are
            effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
            or otherwise makes the Original Software available to a
            third party under the terms of this License.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is

            Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
    available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
    Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
    the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this
    License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
    Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must
    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
    form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
    used for software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You
    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
    License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may
    not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
    or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
    the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
    of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may
    choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
    under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
    the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
    Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
    such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
    other code not governed by the terms of this License and
    distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
    for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
    publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
    time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
    Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
    steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
    License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
    If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
    Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
    available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
    of the version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
    the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
    and remove any references to the name of the license steward
    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
    (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
    differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
    COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
    WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
    ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
    the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
    assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
    the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
    the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
    under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
    or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
    INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
    APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
    defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
    computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
    C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
    documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
    (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
    rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
    lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
    provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
    under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed
    by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
    if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
    conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this
    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
    in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
    for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
    reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
    of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which
    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree
    that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
    States export administration regulations (and the export control
    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
    distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to
make, have made, use and sell ("offer to sell and import") the Original Code,
Modifications, or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such
patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination
with other software, the Original Code, Modifications, or any combination or
portions thereof.

(c)

(d)

2.2. Contributor Grant.

Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make,
have made, use and sell ("offer to sell and import") the Contributor Version (or
portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably
necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination with other software,
the Contributor Version (or portions thereof).

(c)

(d)

3 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

3.1. Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer in
Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License. 3.3. Description
of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any
change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in
any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You
describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

(a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the
claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing
lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.

(c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant
to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for
such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name
as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose
to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under
a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or any Contributor. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered
Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the
documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

3.8. Restrictions. You may not remove any product identification, copyright,
proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.

4 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to
the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand
it.

5 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

6.1. New Versions.

Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License.

6.3. Derivative Works.

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any
confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be
deemed to be modifications of this License.)

properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

8.2.

8.3.

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent
where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
survive termination.

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND

NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with
respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for
a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user,
assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding. All
Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software
(or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must
be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation
must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent
JPEG Group".

(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full
responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY
for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed
by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by
the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that
you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c
for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the
foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is
copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same
holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh). Another
support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely
distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To
avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been
removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF
decoders.

We are required to state that

"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe
Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."
