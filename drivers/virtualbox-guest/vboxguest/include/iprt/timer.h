/** @defgroup grp_rt_timer      RTTimer - Timer
 *
 * The IPRT timer API provides a simple abstraction of recurring and one-shot callback timers.
 *
 * Because of the great variation in the native APIs and the quality of
 * the service delivered by those native APIs, the timers are operated
 * on at best effort basis.
 *
 * All the ring-3 implementations are naturally at the mercy of the scheduler,
 * which means that the callback rate might vary quite a bit and we might skip
 * ticks. Many systems have a restriction that a process can only have one
 * timer. IPRT currently makes no efforts at multiplexing timers in those kind
 * of situations and will simply fail if you try to create more than one timer.
 *
 * Things are generally better in ring-0. The implementations will use interrupt
 * time callbacks wherever available, and if not, resort to a high priority
 * kernel thread.
