	  Choose Y or M here to include support for the Qualcomm
	  IP Accelerator (IPA), a hardware block present in some
	  Qualcomm SoCs.  The IPA is a programmable protocol processor
	  that is capable of generic hardware handling of IP packets,
	  including routing, filtering, and NAT.  Currently the IPA
	  driver supports only basic transport of network traffic
	  between the AP and modem, on the Qualcomm SDM845 SoC.

	  Note that if selected, the selection type must match that
	  of QCOM_Q6V5_COMMON (Y or M).

	  If unsure, say N.
