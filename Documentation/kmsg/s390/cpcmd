 * Text: "The cpcmd kernel function failed to allocate a response buffer\n"
 * Severity: Warning
 * Description:
 * IPL code, console detection, and device drivers like vmcp or vmlogrdr use
 * the cpcmd kernel function to send commands to the z/VM control program (CP).
 * If a program that uses the cpcmd function does not allocate a contiguous
 * response buffer below 2 GB guest real storage, cpcmd creates a bounce buffer
 * to be used as the response buffer. Because of low memory or memory
 * fragmentation, cpcmd could not create the bounce buffer.
 * User action:
 * Look for related page allocation failure messages and at the stack trace to
 * find out which program or operation failed. Free some memory and retry the
 * failed operation. Consider allocating more memory to your z/VM guest virtual
 * machine.
