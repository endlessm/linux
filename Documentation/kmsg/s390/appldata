 * Text: "Starting the data collection for %s failed with rc=%d\n"

 * Parameter:
 *   @1: appldata module
 *   @2: return code
 * Description:
 * The specified data collection module used the z/VM diagnose call
 * DIAG 0xDC to start writing data. z/VM returned an error and the data
 * collection could not start. If the return code is 5, your z/VM guest
 * virtual machine is not authorized to write data records.
 * User action:
 * If the return code is 5, ensure that your z/VM guest virtual machine's
 * entry in the z/VM directory includes the OPTION APPLMON statement.
 * For other return codes see the section about DIAGNOSE Code X'DC'
 * in "z/VM CP Programming Services".

 * Description:
 * The OS record size grows with the number of CPUs and is adjusted by the
 * appldata_os module in response to CPU hotplug events. For more than 110
 * CPUs the record size would exceed the maximum record size of 4024 bytes

 * User action:
 * If you do not want to collect operating system data, you can ignore this
 * message. If you want to collect operating system data, reconfigure your
 * Linux instance to support less than 110 CPUs.
