/*?
 * Text: "The %s cannot be loaded without z/VM\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: z/VM virtual unit record device driver
 * Description:
 * The z/VM virtual unit record device driver provides Linux with access to
 * z/VM virtual unit record devices like punch card readers, card punches, and
 * line printers. On Linux instances that run in environments other than the
 * z/VM hypervisor, the device driver does not provide any useful function and
 * the corresponding vmur module cannot be loaded.
 * User action:
 * Load the vmur module only on Linux instances that run as guest operating
 * systems of the z/VM hypervisor. If the z/VM virtual unit record device
 * has been compiled into the kernel, ignore this message.

/*?
 * Text: "Kernel function alloc_chrdev_region failed with error code %d\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: error code according to errno definitions
 * Description:
 * The z/VM virtual unit record device driver (vmur) needs to register a range
 * of character device minor numbers from 0x0000 to 0xffff.
 * This registration failed, probably because of memory constraints.
 * User action:
 * Free some memory and reload the vmur module. If the z/VM virtual unit
 * record device driver has been compiled into the kernel reboot Linux.
 * Consider assigning more memory to your LPAR or z/VM guest virtual machine.

 * Description:
 * Linux cannot be suspended while a unit record device is in use.
 * User action:
 * Stop all applications that work on z/VM spool file queues, for example, the
 * vmur tool. Then try again to suspend Linux.
