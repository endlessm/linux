 * Description:
 * Diagnose instruction 0x288 was called to initialize the diag288 watchdog.
 * The diagnose call returned an error that cannot be handled by the device driver.
 * The watchdog stays inactive.
 * A possible reason for this error is that your real or virtual hardware does not support

 * Text: "The watchdog cannot be deactivated\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * Diagnose instruction 0x288 was called to deactivate the diag288 watchdog.
 * The diagnose call returned an error that cannot be handled by the device driver.
 * The watchdog stays active and a watchdog timeout will trigger the configured timeout action.
 * The diag288 watchdog device driver might intentionally be configured to prevent deactivation.
 * User action:
 * You can configure the diag288 watchdog device driver such that it can be deactivated.
 * If the diag288 device driver has been compiled as a separate module, diag288_wdt, reload the module
 * without specifying the 'nowayout' module parameter.
 * If the diag288 device driver has been compiled into your kernel,
 * reboot Linux without specifying the 'diag288.nowayout' kernel parameter'.

 * Text: "Linux cannot be suspended while the watchdog is in use\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * The watchdog must not time out while Linux is suspended.
 * Therefore, the diag288 watchdog device driver prevents Linux from being suspended
 * while the watchdog is in use.
 * User action:
 * i) Stop the watchdog application. ii) If the problem persists, close the watchdog
 * device node by issuing 'echo V > /dev/watchdog'.
 * iii) If the device driver still prevents Linux from being suspended,
 * contact your support organization.
