 * Text: "%d is not a valid cryptographic domain\n"
 * Severity: Warning
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: AP  domain index
 * Description:
 * The cryptographic domain specified for the 'domain=' module or kernel
 * parameter must be an integer in the range 0 to 15.
 * User action:
 * Reload the cryptographic device driver with a correct module parameter.
 * If the device driver has been compiled into the kernel, correct the value
 * in the kernel parameter line and reboot Linux.

 * Text: "The hardware system does not support AP instructions\n"
 * Severity: Warning
 * Description:
 * The ap module addresses AP adapters through AP instructions. The hardware
 * system on which the Linux instance runs does not support AP instructions.
 * The ap module cannot detect any AP adapters.
 * User action:
 * Load the ap module only if your Linux instance runs on hardware that
 * supports AP instructions. If the ap module has been compiled into the kernel,
 * ignore this message.

/*?
 * Text: "Registering adapter interrupts for AP device %02x.%04x failed\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: AP device ID
 *   @2: AP queue
 * Description:
 * The hardware system supports AP adapter interrupts but failed to enable
 * an adapter for interrupts. Possible causes for this error are:
 * i)   The AP adapter firmware does not support AP interrupts.
 * ii)  An AP adapter firmware update to a firmware level that supports AP
 *      adapter interrupts failed.
 * iii) The AP adapter firmware has been successfully updated to a level that
 *      supports AP interrupts but the new firmware has not been activated.
 * User action:
 * Ensure that the firmware on your AP adapters support AP interrupts and that
 * any firmware updates have completed successfully. If necessary, deconfigure
 * your cryptographic adapters and reconfigure them to ensure that any firmware
 * updates become active, then reload the ap module. If the ap module has been
 * compiled into the kernel, reboot Linux.
