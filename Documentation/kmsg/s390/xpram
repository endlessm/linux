/*?
 * Text: "%d is not a valid number of XPRAM devices\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: number of partitions
 * Description:
 * The number of XPRAM partitions specified for the 'devs' module parameter
 * or with the 'xpram.parts' kernel parameter must be an integer in the
 * range 1 to 32. The XPRAM device driver created a maximum of 32 partitions
 * that are probably not configured as intended.
 * User action:
 * If the XPRAM device driver has been compiled as a separate module,
 * unload the module and load it again with a correct value for the 'devs'
 * module parameter. If the XPRAM device driver has been compiled
 * into the kernel, correct the 'xpram.parts' parameter in the kernel
 * command line and restart Linux.

/*?
 * Text: "Not enough expanded memory available\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * The amount of expanded memory required to set up your XPRAM partitions
 * depends on the 'sizes' parameter specified for the xpram module or on
 * the specifications for the 'xpram.parts' parameter if the XPRAM device
 * driver has been compiled into the kernel. Your
 * current specification exceed the amount of available expanded memory.
 * Your XPRAM partitions are probably not configured as intended.
 * User action:
 * If the XPRAM device driver has been compiled as a separate module,
 * unload the xpram module and load it again with an appropriate value
 * for the 'sizes' module parameter. If the XPRAM device driver has been
 * compiled into the kernel, adjust the 'xpram.parts' parameter in the
 * kernel command line and restart Linux. If you need more than the
 * available expanded memory, increase the expanded memory allocation for
 * your virtual hardware or LPAR.

/*?
 * Text: "No expanded memory available\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * The XPRAM device driver has been loaded in a Linux instance that runs
 * in an LPAR or virtual hardware without expanded memory.
 * No XPRAM partitions are created.
 * User action:
 * Allocate expanded memory for your LPAR or virtual hardware or do not
 * load the xpram module. You can ignore this message, if you do not want
 * to create XPRAM partitions.

 * Text: "Resuming the system failed: %s\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: cause of the failure
 * Description:
 * A system cannot be resumed if the expanded memory setup changes
 * after hibernation. Possible reasons for the failure are:
 * - Expanded memory was removed after hibernation.
 * - Size of the expanded memory changed after hibernation.
 * The system is stopped with a kernel panic.
 * User action:
 * Reboot Linux.
