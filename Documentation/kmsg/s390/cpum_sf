 * Description:
 * Sample data was lost because of machine-internal high-priority activities.
 * The sampling facility is stopped.
 * User action:
 * End all performance measurement sessions.  Discard the measurement data,
 * which are likely to be flawed.  Repeat your measurements.
 * If the problem persists, contact your hardware administrator.

 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: reason code
 * Description:
 * The device driver could not initialize the sampling facility support.
 * Possible reason codes are:
 * 0001: The device driver failed to query CPU-measurement sampling facility
 *	 information.
 *
 * 0002: The device driver does not support the basic-sampling function that
 *	 is available on the LPAR within which the Linux instance runs.
 *
 * 0003: The device driver could not register to receive CPU-measurement alerts.
 *	 A possible cause of this problem is memory constraints.
 *
 * 0004: The device driver could not register the Performance Measurement Unit
 *	 (PMU) for the CPU-measurement sampling facility.
 *	 A possible cause of this problem is memory constraints.
 * User action:
 * Consider assigning more memory to your Linux instance.
