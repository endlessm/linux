 * Description:
 * The z/VM *MONITOR record device driver failed to read monitor data
 * because the IUCV REPLY function failed. The read function against

 * since the last read with 0 size is incorrect.
 * User action:
 * Disregard all monitor data that has been read since the last read with

 * and reload the monreader module. If the device driver has been compiled
 * into the kernel, reboot Linux. For more information about possible causes
 * of the error see the IUCV section in "z/VM CP Programming Services" and
 * the *MONITOR section in "z/VM Performance".
