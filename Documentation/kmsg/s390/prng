/*?
 * Text: "prng runs in TDES mode with chunksize=%d and reseed_limit=%u\n"
 * Severity: Informational
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: read chunk size in bytes
 *   @2: reseed limit
 * Description:
 * The pseudo-random number device driver started in triple DES mode.
 * For IBM mainframes earlier than IBM zEnterprise EC12 (zEC12),
 * triple DES is the only available mode.
 * As of zEC12, the preferred mode is SHA-512.
 * User action:
 * If triple DES is the expected mode, no action is required.
 * Otherwise, verify that the prng started with the mode= module or
 * prng.mode= kernel parameter set to a value other than 1.
 * The value 1 forces triple DES mode. Also ensure that the mainframe
 * runs with the latest firmware level.

 * Severity: Informational
 * Description:
 * The pseudo-random number device driver was running in triple DES mode.
 * The device driver module, prng, was unloaded, or it stopped

 * User action:
 * None.

/*?
 * Text: "The prng module cannot start in SHA-512 mode\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * The pseudo-random number device driver was loaded with the mode= module parameter
 * or the prng.mode= kernel parameter set to 2. This setting forces SHA-512 mode,
 * but the required support for MSA 5 is not available. This support requires an IBM
 * zEnterprise EC12 (zEC12) or later mainframe.
 * User action:
 * If your mainframe is earlier than zEC12, set the mode= module or
 * prng.mode= kernel parameter to 0 or 1 to run the
 * pseudo-random number device driver in triple DES mode.
 * Otherwise, ensure that MSA 5 support available.
