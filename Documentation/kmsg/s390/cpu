 * Description:
 * The Linux kernel is used as a system dumper but it runs on more CPUs than
 * it has been compiled for with the CONFIG_NR_CPUS kernel configuration
 * option. The system dump will be created but information on one or more
 * CPUs will be missing.
 * User action:
 * Update the system dump kernel to a newer version that supports more
 * CPUs or reduce the number of installed CPUs and reproduce the problem
 * that should be analyzed. If you send the system dump that prompted this
 * message to a support organization, be sure to communicate that the dump
 * does not include all CPU information.
