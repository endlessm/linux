/*?
 * Text: "Allocating the requested cache size of %zu bytes failed\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: size
 * Description:
 * You cannot use the 'hmcdrv' module.
 * Either the cache size that was specified for the 'hmcdrv' module exceeded
 * the maximum of 1048576 (1 megabyte), or not enough free memory was
 * available.
 * If the 'hmcdrv' module was compiled into the kernel, the cache size was
 * specified with the 'hmcdrv.cachesize' kernel parameter.
 * For a separate 'hmcdrv' module, the cache size was specified with the
 * 'cachesize=' module parameter.
 * User action:
 * Specify a smaller cache size and try again to load the module.
 * Do not exceed the maximum specification of 1048576 (1 megabyte).
 * If necessary, free some memory and try again.
 * If the module is compiled into the kernel, you must reboot Linux to change
 * the cache size specification.
