 * Text: "Not enough memory for %d nodes, reducing node count\n"
 * Severity: Warning
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: requested number of nodes
 * Description:
 * Using the requested memory stripe size for emulating the requested number of
 * NUMA nodes requires more than the available memory. The number of nodes is
 * specified with the emu_nodes= kernel parameter. The memory stripe size to
 * be used for distributing the available memory among the nodes is specified
 * with the emu_size= kernel parameter. Fewer nodes were created than the
 * requested number; each node has one memory stripe of the requested size.
 * User action:
 * Specify fewer nodes, reduce the memory stripe size, or make more memory
 * available to your Linux instance.

 * Parameter:
 *   @1: number of nodes
 *   @2: stripe size
 * Description:
 * NUMA emulation is activated with the reported number of NUMA nodes.
 * The specified memory stripe size is used to distribute, in round-robin

 * User action:
 * None.

 * Text: "Increasing memory stripe size from %ld MB to %ld MB\n"
 * Severity: Warning
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: requested memory stripe size
 *   @2: adjusted memory stripe size
 * Description:
 * NUMA  emulation  could  not  use  the  requested memory stripe size and
 * therefore has increased it to the next possible value.
 * The requested memory stripe size is a default value or it was specified
 * with the emu_size= kernel parameter.
 * The memory stripe size must be a multiple of the memory block size that
 * can be read in hexadecimal notation from
 * /sys/devices/system/memory/block_size_bytes.
 * User action:
 * To avoid this message in the future, specify a valid memory stripe size
 * with the emu_size= kernel parameter.
