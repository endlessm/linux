 * Text: "Memory hotplug state changed, suspend refused.\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Description:
 * Suspend is refused after a memory hotplug operation was performed.
 * User action:
 * The system needs to be restarted and no memory hotplug operation must be
 * performed in order to allow suspend.

 * Text: "Standby memory at 0x%llx (%lluM of %lluM usable)\n"
 * Severity: Informational
 * Parameter:
 * @1: start address of standby memory
 * @2: usable memory in MB
 * @3: total detected memory in MB
 * Description:
 * Standby memory was detected. It can be used for memory hotplug only
 * if it is aligned to the Linux hotplug memory block size.
 * If the aligned amount of memory matches the total amount,
 * all detected standby memory can be used. Otherwise, some of the detected
 * memory is unaligned and cannot be used.
 * User action:
 * None, if the usable and the total amount of detected standby memory match.
 * If the amounts of memory do not match,
 * check the memory setup of your guest virtual machine and ensure that
 * the standby memory start and end
 * address is aligned to the Linux hotplug memory block size.
 * On Linux, issue "cat /sys/devices/system/memory/block_size_bytes"
 * to find the hotplug memory block size value in hexadecimal notation.
 * On z/VM, query your memory setup with "vmcp q v store".
