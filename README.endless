Overview
========
Our process for handling linux for Endless is a little different than
our other packages. Although the source is in github, we're not having
it built by jenkins and submitted to OBS. Instead, a debian source
package should be created on the local user's machine and committed to
OBS by the user.

Since we're using Ubuntu's kernel from git as our base, we try to stick
to their process so that the existing tooling works correctly.
Documentation on the Ubuntu kernel process can be found here:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/KernelMaintenance

Making changes
==============
Normal changes are made in git without updating the debian changelog. In
order to have our changes be recorded by the debian packaging as not
coming from upstream, prepend the commit subject with "UBUNTU: ".

Preparing a new source package
==============================
Details of Ubuntu's uploading process are provided here:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/KernelMaintenance#Preparing_an_upload

There are some changes in our process from that document. When you're
ready to upload a new revision to OBS, run:

  ./debian/rules insertchanges

This will add all the git log entries to debian.master/changelog. Open
that file to ensure that the version and entries are correct.

Prior to releasing, we have to move the ABI files to the current
version. For example, if the previous version was 3.13.0-1.1endless1,
then the current version is 3.13.0-1.1endless2. When OBS starts a build,
it adds another suffix to the version number. Therefore, from its
perspective, the previous version is our current version,
3.13.0-1.1endless2. When the build completes, the Ubuntu tooling
compares that the ABI of the built version to the previous version. With
that in mind, run:

  git mv debian.master/abi/3.13.0-1.1endless{1,2}

Now you're ready to make the commit marking the new version. The format
of the message is important for detecting changes between versions.

  git add debian.master/changelog
  git commit -m "UBUNTU: release 3.13.0-1.1endless2"

Ensure the checkout is clean and all control files have been created.

  fakeroot ./debian/rules clean

Create the debian source package for OBS. Since this is a git checkout,
we want to ignore the git files in the generated source.

  dpkg-buildpackage -S -us -uc -I.git -I.gitignore -i'\.git.*'

Commit the source package to OBS as normal.

Preparing for the next version
==============================
Immediately after uploading the current release, the changelog needs to
be prepped for the next release. We assume that only the local endless
version will be incremented. Run:

  ./debian/rules startnewendless

This should create placeholder changelog entry for the next revision,
3.13.0-1.1endless3 using the example version above. Commit this change
and add "Ignore: yes" in the commit message so it doesn't get added to
the debian changelog later.

  git add debian.master/changelog
  msg=$(echo -e 'UBUNTU: Start new release\n\nIgnore: yes')
  git commit -m "$msg"

Now you can run

  ./debian/rules printchanges

at any time to see the changes since the last version.
