#
# SAUCE refers to the fact that this patch might not go upstream, but we need to
# carry it to successive releases. In most cases you DONOT want to use this
# template. 
#
# An example of a SAUCE patch is the ACPI DSDT-in-initramfs patch which has been
# refused upstream, but still provides useful functionality to users with broken
# BIOSes.
