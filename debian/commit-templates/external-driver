# Ubuntu external driver commit.
#
# NOTE: This gets reformatted for README.Ubuntu-External-Drivers and
# debian/changelog.
#
# This is only needed when a driver is added, updated or removed. It is
# not needed when patches or fixes are applied to the driver. If the
# driver is being removed, add the line:
#
# Removing: yes
#
# to the commit, and you can remove all other tags (except UBUNTU:).
