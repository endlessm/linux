Scripts placed in this directory get called one at a time by run-parts(8).
The scripts are expected to perform some sort of sanity checks on the
finished build. Scripts will be called once for each flavour.

Some environment variables are exported to make life a little easier:

DPKG_ARCH     : The dpkg architecture (e.g. "amd64")
KERN_ARCH     : The kernel architecture (e.g. "x86_64")
FLAVOUR       : The specific flavour for this run (e.g. "generic")
VERSION       : The full version of this build (e.g. 2.6.22-1)
REVISION      : The exact revision of this build (e.g. 1.3)
PREV_REVISION : The revision prior to this one
ABI_NUM       : The specific ABI number for this build (e.g. 2)
PREV_ABI_NUM  : The previous ABI number. Can be the same as ABI_NUM.
BUILD_DIR     : The directory where this build took place
INSTALL_DIR   : The directory where the package is prepared
SOURCE_DIR    : Where the main kernel source is

Scripts are expected to have a zero exit status when no problems occur,
and non-zero when an error occurs that should stop the build. Scripts
should print whatever info they deem needed to deduce the problem.
