# When we install linux-image we have to run kernel postinst.d support to
# generate the initramfs, create links etc.  Should it have an associated
# linux-image-extra package and we install that we also need to run kernel
# postinst.d, to regenerate the initramfs.  If we are installing both at the
# same time, we necessarily trigger kernel postinst.d twice. As this includes
# rebuilding the initramfs and reconfiguring the boot loader this is very time
# consuming.
#
# Similarly for removal when we remove the linux-image-extra package we need to
# run kernel postinst.d handling in order to pare down the initramfs to
# linux-image contents only.  When we remove the linux-image need to remove the
# now redundant initramfs.  If we are removing both at the same time, then
# we will rebuilt the initramfs and then immediatly remove it.
#
# Switches to using a trigger against the linux-image package for all
# postinst.d and postrm.d handling.  On installation postinst.d gets triggered
# twice once by linux-image and once by linux-image-extra.  As triggers are
# non-cumulative we will only run this processing once.  When removing both
# packages we will trigger postinst.d from linux-image-extra and then in
# linux-image postrm.d we effectivly ignore the pending trigger and simply run
# the postrm.d.  This prevents us from rebuilding the initramfs.
