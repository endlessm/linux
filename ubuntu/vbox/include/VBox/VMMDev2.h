 *       We will now have to carefully check how our compilers have treated this
 *       flag. If any are compressing it into a byte type, we'll have to check
 *       how the request memory is initialized. If we are 104% sure it's ok to
 *       expand it, we'll expand it. If not, we must redefine the field to a
 *       uint8_t and a 3 byte padding.
